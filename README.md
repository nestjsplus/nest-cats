### Introduction

This repository is designed as a companion for the [official NestJS docs](https://docs.nestjs.com).

#### TLDR;

**What's the purpose of this repository?** While there's an underlying theme to the official docs, the chapters don't exactly line up and build on each other in a way you can **execute** the features introduced in each one. This is **not** a criticism. There's good reason for this, as the docs currently serve as both an intro _tutorial_ and an on-going _reference_ for more experienced developers.

The concept of this repository is to knit together each of the chapters in the NestJS docs to produce a single, cohesive application that mirrors the documentation.

Each chapter is represented as a pair of branches in the repository (one for the start of the chapter, one for the end), so it's simple to jump immediately to any state (e.g., "as of the end of the *Providers* chapter") to see a working app *at that point in time*. You can "live code" from there by following along with the docs, or just use this as a test-bed, built on a well-known foundation, for some feature you're working on.

The easiest way to see this is to view a complete version (corresponding to the completion of [this chapter](https://github.com/johnbiundo/catse2e/wiki/cats-enhancements) -- i.e., just before the *Authentication* chapter) of the _Nest Cats_ app, which you can do [at codesandbox.io, here](https://codesandbox.io/s/nest-cats-w89jw). You should quickly recognize the close relationship between the app and the code snippets in the [official docs](https://docs.nestjs.com). The difference is that this app runs in its entirety -- an _end-to-end cats_ application, if you will.
