### Introduction

This repository is designed as a companion for the [official NestJS docs](https://docs.nestjs.com).

#### TLDR;

**What's the purpose of this repository?** While there's an underlying theme to the official docs, the chapters don't exactly line up and build on each other in a way you can **execute** the features introduced in each one. This is **not** a criticism. There's good reason for this, as the docs currently serve as both an intro _tutorial_ and an on-going _reference_ for more experienced developers.

The concept of this repository is to knit together each of the chapters in the NestJS docs to produce a single, cohesive application that mirrors the documentation.

The easiest way to see this is to view a complete version of the _Nest Cats_ app, which you can do [at codesandbox.io, here](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/nestjsplus/nest-cats). You should quickly recognize the close relationship between the app and the code snippets in the [official docs](https://docs.nestjs.com). The difference is that this app runs in its entirety -- an _end-to-end cats_ application, if you will.
